## Usage

### Recording Audio

- Click the microphone icon in the left ribbon or run the **"Record Audio"** command from the command palette.
- In the record modal, start recording. When done, you can choose:
    - **Stop & Save**: Saves the audio file to the configured "Audio Directory" without transcribing.
    - **Stop & Transcribe**: Saves the audio file and proceeds to transcription.
        - If AI Editing is enabled in settings, a modal will first appear asking you to select a System Prompt Template.
        - If you cancel template selection, only the audio file is saved, and transcription is aborted.
        - If confirmed, the audio is transcribed, and then the transcript is processed by the AI editor using the selected template.

### Transcribing Existing Audio Files

- Right-click any `.webm`, `.m4a`, or `.mp3` file in the file explorer.
- Select **"Transcribe with AI"**.
    - If AI Editing is enabled in settings, a modal will first appear asking you to select a System Prompt Template.
    - If you cancel template selection, the entire transcription task is aborted.
    - If confirmed, the audio is transcribed, and then the transcript is processed by the AI editor using the selected template.
    - If AI Editing is disabled, the audio is transcribed, and the raw transcript is saved.

### Editing Existing Transcripts

- Open a raw transcript file (typically a `.md` file).
- Run the **"Edit Current Transcript with AI"** command from the command palette.
    - A modal will appear asking you to select a System Prompt Template to use for editing.
    - If you cancel template selection, the editing process is aborted.
    - If confirmed, the AI editor will process the current text using the selected template.
- The plugin will then use the configured AI editor settings and the selected System Prompt to process and refine the transcript.

### Transcript Output

- Raw transcript: saved as `<audio_basename>_raw_transcript.md`
- Edited transcript: saved as `<audio_basename>_edited_transcript.md` (if AI Editing is enabled)
- Files are written to the **Transcript Directory** configured in settings.
